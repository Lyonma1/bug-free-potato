Well, I have to write something to see if I know how to do commits via the bash.
Now writing a different line because the first one has been committed, but I need to test.
One more change to test what git tells me about the push.
Testing if I have been committing wrong.
Testing to see if git bash works on my pc.
Testing to see what the name is if I push.
New change.
